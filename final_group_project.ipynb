    "There are many elements that play a role in how well a student will perform on a test. The objective for this group project is predicting the knowledge level of an individual based on such elements. The knowledge levels include: `high`, `middle`, `low` and `very_low` We will be looking at the \"User Knowledge\" dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data in this dataset looks at `STG` (the degree of study time for goal object materials), `SCG` (the degree of repetition number of user for goal object materials), `STR` (the degree of study time of user for related objects with goal object), `LPR` (the exam performance of user for related object with goal object), and `PEG` (the exam performance of user for goal objects). As well, it relates PEG to `UNS` (the knowledge level of the user). This data will be used as predictors for `UNS`\n",

    "Our predictive question that we will try to answer is: “Can we predict the `UNS` of an individual based on factors such as `STG`, `SCG`, and `STR`?”\n",
